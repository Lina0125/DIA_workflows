##### Introduction

These workflows is written using snakemake language with some python language inside, 
they can used to proteomics research,especially for DIA MS collected data,and allow 
users to generate spectral library (snakefile_library) and get EncyclopeDIA quantitative
results(snakefile_quantitation).In order to execute snakemake workflow for library generation
or for quantitative reports,the installation of java,python,docker and snakemake is required.
Two workflows can be download from https://github.com/Lina0125/DIA_workflows and can be put at 
any directory. Since every path in workflow is absolute and some reference data is needed, 
downloading two directories called "bin" and "ref" from  https://github.com/Lina0125/DIA_workflows 
repository and putting them in the same directory with snakefile are strongly recommend. 
The directory of the files to generate the library or to get quantitative results should be pass
 to the workflow as a variable values via the command line.



##### Environment and software support:

java
docker
encyclopedia-0.9.5-executable.jar
python
snakemake


##### Uses

For library generation:

$Library_dir='your path of files to generate the library' snakemake

For quantitative analysis:

$Quantitation_dir='your path of files to generate the library' snakemake
